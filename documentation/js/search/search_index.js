musical scales on the fretboard of a string instrument.\nBy default, it contains a database of both scales (with corresponding modes) and instruments (with corresponding tunings).\nBut scales and tunings are entirely customizable as well, including local saving and loading of custom content,\nand automatic search algorithms to check if identical or similar content already exists in the database.\nAny given scale/fretboard configuration can be exported as a PNG or TXT file.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nThe product owner's address information has not been uploaded to this repository, which may lead to errors. To run the server, you need to create a secrets.ts\nfile in the project base folder containing code with the following structure:\nExample :import { Address } from \"./src/interfaces/address\";\n\nexport const LEGAL: { address: Address } = {\n    address: {\n        name: 'myName',\n        street: 'myStreet',\n        city: 'myCity',\n        country: 'myCountry',\n        contact: {\n            phone: 'myPhone',\n            email: {\n                name: 'myEmailName',\n                provider: 'myEmailProvider'\n            }\n        }\n    },\n};Code scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nBuild documentation\nRun npm run compodoc:build to build the documentation.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help
